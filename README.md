## ðŸ§¾ Project Summary: Electronics Price Prediction & Market Analysis
### ðŸ§  Objective
This project explores electronics product pricing and market trends using statistical and machine learning methods.
It aims to identify key factors influencing product prices and uncover category-level sales patterns over time.
## Total Revenue by Product category

## ðŸ“Š Key Analyses and Insights
1. Price Distribution
Product prices show significant variation across categories and brands.
Premium brands (e.g., Apple, Samsung) dominate high-end segments, while others (e.g., Lenovo, HP) target mid-range consumers.
Specs-related features such as SSD presence, RAM capacity, and display type are strong price drivers.
2. Revenue and Category Performance
Smartphones and Laptops contribute the largest share of total revenue (~70â€“75%).
Accessories and Wearables show high unit sales but low per-unit margins.
Top 20% of categories contribute nearly 80% of total revenue â€” a classic Pareto effect.
3. Temporal Trends
Sales have shown steady year-over-year growth, with seasonal peaks during Q4 (holiday shopping) and product launch periods (Marchâ€“April).
Time series analysis revealed recurring seasonal patterns and long-term positive trends in electronics demand.
4. Category Growth & Volatility
Smartphones and Laptops display the most consistent growth over time (low volatility).
Gaming and Accessories categories show higher sales volatility â€” likely driven by new releases and promotional cycles.
Category-level analysis helps balance inventory and marketing budgets.
* Linear models captured general trends but struggled with complex feature interactions.
* Ensemble methods substantially improved predictive performance, explaining ~91% of price variance.
